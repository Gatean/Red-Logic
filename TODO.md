# The Grand TODO List
**In order of to-accomplish-ness**

## Logic Gates
### Make Graphics (Done)
Impliment non-RP2/Vanilla graphics
### Make blockLogicDefault
The default class that will be the basis for all logic gates
### Repeater
Base off vanilla repeater, use as learning curve.
### Restof Logic Gates
Yeah... We will get there when we get there.
### Impliment Glaze
Item used in the making of slabs (the base of the gates).
Will probably be made with slime balls + iron in a brewstand.
### Impliment Formable Redstone
A thick goo-y redstone material that can be used in the formation of redstone wires on slabs
Will probably bemade with redstone + iron in a brewstand.
### Impliment Recipies
Uses On-Off wire + glazed slabs + Forable Redstone (tbd)
### Impliment Marble and Basalt
Use metadata blocks to allow the (completly visual) use of marble and basalt in the creation of slabs.

## World Generation
### Make Blocks (Done)
Impliment Basalt, Basalt Cobble, Basalt Bricks, Marble, and Marble Bricks
### Texture Blocks (Done)
Make non-RP2/Vanilla textures for blocks.
### Impliment World Gen
Generate Basalt around lava-gen (lakes and underground pools).
Generate Marble in levels 15-40 in slate-form (off-set horizontal discs).
Generate undergroud water-pools ~the same size as under ground lava pools, generate marble around it.
Generate volcanos of varining height by-altitude and size (made form basalt)
Generate Marble "vertical pillars" (more discriptions later) around lakes.
### Impliment Smelting and Recipies
Basalt Cobble -Smelt-> Basalt
Bricks made as usual with material
Glazed Basalt Slabs and Glazed Marble Slabs to be used as 'fancy' replacements for Stone Glazed Slabs in Logic Gate Recipies.
