Red Logic is an opensource RP2 Logic alternative, that is seeking to open up the world of redstone related mods to hopefully main stream the idea. Who knows what amazing things will come from having an opensource base for redstone mods?

# How To Begin Coding
## Setup
### Obtaining Forge
The first step to get your Forge development environment setup. The first thing you are going to want to do is create a directory to place your environment in (e.g. "C:\forge" or "/home/user/.forge").  
Now, download the [latest] (http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/minecraftforge-src-1.4.5-6.4.2.448.zip) Forge source ([adfly] (http://adf.ly/673885/http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/minecraftforge-src-1.4.5-6.4.2.448.zip)), and extract to to our working directory.
If your running Windows, simply run "install.cmd", if your on linux, you will need to download Wine with "sudo apt-get install wine" (Ubuntu) if you have not done so already, then run "install.sh".  This script will download MCP and the minecraft clients you will need, as well as run all the necessary decompilation.
### Installing Eclipse and Using Forge
If you have not already, go install eclipse. For Windows users, the link to the Eclipse website is below, for Ubuntu (Linux) users, you know the drill "sudo apt-get install eclipse".  
Now run Eclipse, when it asks you for your workspace, you are going to want to direct it to the eclipse folder in your working directory (e.g. "C:\forge\MCP\eclipse" or "/home/user/.forge/mcp/eclipse"), now click OK.  
In our Project Explorer you should see the source folder called "Minecraft", if you do, your good to go, if not, your a failure at life, go to the Forge Wiki and see if you can't figure out where you went wrong, if all else fails, post in the MCF Topic.
### Downloading the Red Logic Source
Okay, here is where the real fun begins.  To start, you are going to want to install git, for Ubuntu users "sudo apt-get install git", and for Windows, go get the [latest] (http://git-scm.com/download/win) windows binaries.  
Now head to where you are going to keep your projects (e.g. "C:\Users\User\Projects" or "/home/user/Projects") in your command line (windows users, that would be that "cmd" thing you keep using) and type "git clone git://github.com/StGermain/Red-Logic.git". This will create a folder called "Red-Logic" and in it you will find all the source code and images you need to work with.
